    "# Properly Ordered Card Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "The 538 Riddler [presented](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-capture-the-most-james-bonds/) this problem by Matt Ginsberg:\n",
    "    \n",
    "> *You play so many card games that you’ve developed a very specific organizational obsession. When you’re dealt your hand, you want to organize it such that the cards of a given suit are grouped together and, if possible, such that no suited groups of the same color are adjacent. (Numbers don’t matter to you.) Moreover, when you receive your randomly ordered hand, you want to achieve this organization with a single motion, moving only one adjacent block of cards to some other position in your hand, maintaining the original order of that block and other cards, except for that one move.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Suppose you’re playing pitch, in which a hand has six cards. What are the odds that you can accomplish your obsessive goal? What about for another game, where a hand has N cards, somewhere between 1 and 13?*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Brute Force Versus Cleverness\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to decide is how many `N`-card hands are there? If there are only a few, I could just enumerate them all and count how many are orderable. If there are a lot, I'll have to be more clever. The answer is (52 choose `N`), so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 cards: 20,358,520 hands\n",
    "- 13 cards: 635,013,559,600 hands \n",
    "\n",
    "That's a lot. Time for a small dose of cleverness. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Hands: Suits\n",
    "\n",
    "I notice that the problem says *\"Numbers don’t matter,\"* so I can abstract away from *cards* to *suits*: instead of saying that the first card in this hand is the seven of spades, I can just say it is a spade. Then there are only 4<sup>N</sup> abstract hands (for N &le; 13), so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 cards: 4,096 abstract hands\n",
    "- 13 cards: 67,108,864 abstract hands\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a big improvement! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's start coding. There are two red suits and two black suits, so I'll represent the four suits as `'rRbB'`.  I'll represent an abstract hand as a string of suits: `'rrBrbr'` is a 6-card hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Deals: Hands and their Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll define `deals(N)` to return a dict of all possible abstract hands of length `N`, each mapped to the probability of the hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "With actual hands, every hand has the same probability, because every card is equally likely to be the next card dealt. But with abstract hands, the probability of the next suit depends on how many cards of that suit have already been dealt. If I've already dealt the 12 cards `'rrrrrrrrrrrr'`, then the probability of the next card being an `'r'` is 1/40, and the probability of it being a `'b'` is 13/40. So as I build up the abstract hands, I'll need to keep track of the number of remaining cards of each suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use `Fraction` to get exact arithmetic and `lru_cache` to avoid repeated computations."

    "\n",
    "1. **An orderable sequence can have at most 7 runs.** We know that a properly ordered hand can have at most 4 runs. But a move can reduce the number of runs by at most 3:  one run can be reduced when we remove the block (if the cards on either side of the block are the same), and two more can be reduced when we re-insert the block (if the left and right ends match the surrounding suits). Here's an example of moving a block [bracketed] to reduce the number of runs from 6 to 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "       bRB[bR]B   =>   b[bR]RBB  =   bRB\n",
    "       \n",
    "2. **Adding a suit to the end of an unorderable sequence can't make it orderable.** To show that, take an unordered sequence, and see what happens if you take the extra suit and insert it anywhere in the sequence. If the sequence was unordered because it repeats a suit, adding a suit can't fix that. If it was unordered because suits of the same color are adjacent, then adding a suit of the other color *could* fix that: `'bBR'` could be fixed by inserting a `'r'` to get `'brBR'`. But here's the catch: `'bBR'` is not unorderable. And if we are going to insert a new suit between two others, that means that the original sequence must have had at most three suits (because when we add one, we can't get more than four suits in an ordered sequence), and *every* three-suit sequence is orderable.  And if that argument doesn't convince you, below I look at all the sequences from `deals(7)` (which we know is the longest length we need to look at) and show that if a sequence is not orderable, then no matter what suit you add to it, the result is not orderable:"

From `N` = 8 and up, almost all the computation goes into computing the probability of each hand, and collapsing the hand into a sequence, not into deciding the orderability of each sequence.\n",
